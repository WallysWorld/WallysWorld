# About me
    Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BS in CS). I've learned JS in the past, and I'm currently learning C++ and Java. I post my school projects here to build my portfolio and document my experience and skills as I continue learning in different programming languages.
